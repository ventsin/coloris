# coloris
Basic image editor focused on simple gradients.

For the moment, it's still in it's infancy, but I'm proud to finally present Coloris, a simple image editor focused on generating gradients.

The code is not particularly consistent or very well written, but I hope to improve it with each new version as time goes on.
